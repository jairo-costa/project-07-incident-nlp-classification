    "## **1) What operational scenarios do I imagine when reading an incident report?**\n",
    "\n",
    "*(Describe a few hypothetical incident messages and what they imply operationally.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "During the review of the incident report, the following operational scenarios came to mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "Route Obstruction:\n",
    "Ongoing road construction led to two streets along the planned delivery route being blocked for an indefinite period, requiring immediate rerouting.\n",
    "\n",
    "System / Connectivity Failure:\n",
    "An internet connectivity issue prevented the GPS application from updating in real time, causing inaccurate tracking information and operational delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistics Capacity Constraint:\n",
    "A shipment remained at the distribution center for three consecutive days due to the lack of an available vehicle assigned to that route.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vehicle Breakdown:\n",
    "A delivery vehicle experienced a mechanical failure due to insufficient preventive maintenance, rendering it non-operational and interrupting the delivery sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2) Which incident types do I believe are the most critical for SLA? Why?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The most critical incident types for SLA performance, in order of severity, are:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vehicle breakdowns (especially due to lack of maintenance)**  \n",
    "   These incidents immediately interrupt the delivery chain and can halt an entire route.  \n",
    "   A breakdown typically creates cascading delays, affects multiple orders, and has no quick workaround unless contingency vehicles or repair teams are readily available.  \n",
    "   This makes it one of the highest-impact events for SLA compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Shipments stuck at the distribution center for extended periods**  \n",
    "   When a package remains in the hub for several days, the SLA is already at risk before the delivery even begins.  \n",
    "   Regardless of the root cause, prolonged stagnation indicates a structural failure in capacity planning or resource allocation, making it an operational red flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Internet or system connectivity failures**  \n",
    "   These incidents disrupt real-time tracking, routing updates, and communication with drivers.  \n",
    "   Although typically resolvable, they degrade visibility and decision-making, increasing the likelihood of SLA breaches due to delayed responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Road construction or route blockages**  \n",
    "   These events require rerouting and may add significant travel time, but they are generally predictable and can often be mitigated with advance planning or updated routing strategies.  \n",
    "   As a result, their SLA impact is lower compared to system failures or vehicle breakdowns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3) If I had to manually classify 300 incident messages per day, what patterns would I look for?**\n",
    "\n",
    "If I were manually classifying a large volume of incident messages, I would look for specific keywords and linguistic patterns that indicate the nature and urgency of the issue. These terms act as strong semantic signals for operational categorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **“vehicle breakdown”, “mechanical failure”, “engine issue”**  \n",
    "  → Indicates a vehicle-related incident with high SLA risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **“delivery delay”, “running late”, “behind schedule”**  \n",
    "  → Suggests time-related issues affecting route performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **“unable to deliver”, “customer not found”, “address issue”**  \n",
    "  → Points to delivery exceptions that may require reattempt or rerouting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **“road blocked”, “construction”, “route closed”, “obstruction”**  \n",
    "  → Signals external route disruptions that impact travel time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **“vehicle maintenance”, “needs repair”, “inspection required”**  \n",
    "  → Suggests structural issues that may affect fleet availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **“shipment stuck”, “order held”, “item not dispatched”**  \n",
    "  → Indicates stagnation at the distribution center, a strong SLA warning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **“no tracking”, “system not updating”, “GPS error”**  \n",
    "  → Implies system or connectivity issues that reduce visibility and response speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "These keyword patterns help identify the probable incident type quickly, even before examining the full context.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4) What kinds of text noise do I expect?**\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding the context of the possible message sender — including the operational situation, sense of urgency, and commitment to keeping the operation running — I expect to encounter several types of text noise in the incident reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Typos and misspellings**\n",
    "Often caused by haste, mobile typing, or voice-to-text errors:\n",
    "- “vihacles nreakdaw”\n",
    "- “fail car”\n",
    "- “ingene poblem”\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Incomplete or truncated messages**\n",
    "Typically written under time pressure or connectivity issues:\n",
    "- “cannot deliv...”\n",
    "- “intercep...”\n",
    "- “delay...”\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Role-specific operational vocabulary**\n",
    "Messages may contain terms, abbreviations, or jargon commonly used by drivers, dispatchers, or hub operators, which may not follow standard language conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Slang and functional expressions**\n",
    "Informal or shorthand expressions used to communicate quickly within the operation, often relying on shared contextual knowledge rather than grammatical accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "These characteristics reflect real-world operational communication and reinforce the need for robust NLP preprocessing rather than rigid keyword rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5) What makes NLP necessary here instead of simple keyword rules?**\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP is essential in this scenario because it can account for multiple factors that influence how operational messages are written and interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "By processing natural language, NLP models are able to:\n",
    "- capture linguistic patterns and behavioral signals present in human communication,\n",
    "- distinguish contextual meaning, reducing ambiguity and avoiding double or multiple interpretations,\n",
    "- identify the underlying intent behind incident messages rather than relying solely on isolated keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "This contextual understanding allows the model to reduce category overlap and misclassification.\n",
    "By evaluating language patterns together with operational behavior, NLP significantly increases the accuracy and reliability of incident interpretation compared to rigid, rule-based approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **6) How do I think class imbalance will appear in this dataset?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Proper incident classification is critical to enable action plans that are aligned with both the urgency and the frequency of each event.\n",
    "\n",
    "By classifying incidents accurately, the operation can:\n",
    "- define response priorities based on risk to SLA,\n",
    "- allocate resources more efficiently,\n",
    "- distinguish between recurring operational issues and rare but critical events,\n",
    "- and ensure that high-impact incidents receive immediate attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without structured classification, all incidents tend to be treated similarly, which leads to delayed responses, inefficient prioritization, and increased operational risk.\n",
    "Therefore, classification is not only a technical task but a key decision-support mechanism for operational management.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **7) Do I expect short or long descriptions? Why?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Both short and long incident descriptions are expected, depending on the severity and complexity of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, mechanical issues often require longer descriptions so that the resolution team has full context regarding the failure, symptoms, and constraints. This additional detail helps accelerate diagnosis and reduce downtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, route obstructions or external events such as road closures can usually be described briefly, as a short message is often sufficient to communicate the issue and trigger a rerouting decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **8) Which classification errors are the most dangerous for SLA?**\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most harmful classification errors is treating incidents of different complexity as if they were equivalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance:\n",
    "- grouping all mechanical failures under the same category ignores differences in severity and recovery time;\n",
    "- failing to distinguish between a complete road closure and a temporary traffic congestion can lead to incorrect prioritization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such misclassifications may delay critical responses, allocate resources inefficiently, and ultimately increase the risk of SLA breaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **9) When comparing TF-IDF vs Embeddings, what differences do I expect?**\n",
    "\n",
    "I expect the models to provide a deeper level of insight beyond simple categorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "This includes:\n",
    "- a more accurate evaluation of context,\n",
    "- better interpretation of operational scenarios,\n",
    "- and clearer differentiation between incident severity levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "With richer contextual understanding, the classification results become more reliable and actionable, directly supporting better decision-making and faster operational responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✔️ Notes  \n",

    "The objective is not only to categorize incidents, but to support faster and more accurate operational decision-making, especially in scenarios that pose a risk to Service Level Agreements (SLA).\n",
    "\n",
    "By structuring and interpreting textual incident descriptions, the model should help prioritize responses, allocate resources efficiently, and reduce operational delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2) What type of data do I expect to receive?**\n",
    "\n",
    "I expect primarily unstructured textual data containing incident descriptions written by different operational actors such as drivers, dispatchers, and hub operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is likely to include:\n",
    "- short and long descriptions,\n",
    "- informal language,\n",
    "- typos and abbreviations,\n",
    "- role-specific operational vocabulary,\n",
    "- incomplete or truncated messages caused by urgency or connectivity issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional metadata (such as timestamps or categories) may exist, but the core challenge lies in understanding the text itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3) Is this a supervised or unsupervised problem? Why?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **supervised learning problem**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to map incident descriptions to predefined categories or severity levels based on historical examples.  \n",
    "Each message is expected to have an associated label that represents the incident type, urgency, or operational impact, which enables model training and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4) Why is NLP appropriate for this scenario?**\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP is appropriate because operational incident reports contain contextual meaning that cannot be reliably captured using simple rules or keyword matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through NLP techniques, it is possible to:\n",
    "- interpret context rather than isolated words,\n",
    "- reduce ambiguity and overlapping meanings,\n",
    "- identify the intent behind messages,\n",
    "- and handle linguistic variability caused by human communication under pressure.\n",

    "This makes NLP far more effective than rigid, rule-based approaches for real operational environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5) What are the main challenges I anticipate?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Key challenges include:\n",
    "- ambiguous language and overlapping incident categories,\n",
    "- noisy text with typos and informal expressions,\n",
    "- class imbalance between frequent and rare but critical incidents,\n",

    "**Classical NLP approaches:**\n",
    "- TF-IDF vectorization combined with Logistic Regression\n",
    "- TF-IDF combined with tree-based models\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modern approaches:**\n",
    "- Embedding-based representations with similarity or classification layers\n",
    "- Comparative analysis between classical and embedding-based methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The comparison will focus not only on performance metrics, but also on interpretability and operational applicability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **7) Which evaluation metrics matter most for the business?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond overall accuracy, metrics such as:\n",
    "- Recall per class,\n",
    "- F1-score,\n",
    "- and confusion matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "are critical, especially for high-impact incident categories.  \n",
    "Misclassifying severe incidents as low priority poses a much greater SLA risk than the opposite error.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
